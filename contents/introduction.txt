# Introduction

The ability to communicate information requires prior agreement on the languages and procedures used among the parties doing the communication.  Developing the necessary agreements takes effort (sometimes a vast amount of effort), and often leads to codification of the agreements in the form of guidelines or formal standards.  The goal of this handbook is to provide guidance and suggestions for how to organize the process of reaching agreement, particularly in the context of technical standards for information technologies.  It is geared towards standardization efforts undertaken by persons working in academia, though much of the information in this handbook no doubt applies to standardization efforts by commercial and other entities.

This handbook draws on the experiences of the authors working in software standards for computational biology and bioinformatics.  We believe that standards and standard operating procedures are essential for the progress of science.  After experiencing first-hand how difficult it is to develop standards, we decided that capturing some of our lessons and ideas would benefit not only ourselves, but others who also want to engage in the development of standards.
