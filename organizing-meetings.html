<h1 id="organizing-meetings"><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Organizing meetings</h1>
<p>Different types of meetings are designed to fulfill different goals. Some meetings are more focused on presentation of knowledge, while others are more focused on discussions between participants. There are many common practical aspects of organizing and running meetings, and we discuss these practical matters in this chapter.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-meetings-and-their-purposes"><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Types of meetings and their purposes</h2>
<p>It helps to identify the most common types of meetings encountered in science, so that some of the choices in organization and management can be related back to the meeting type. Choosing the right type of meeting is important not least because potential attendees often calibrate their expectations based on the meeting type designation.</p>
<p>The following list includes more types of meetings than those used solely for standards organization; this is to provide more context for the explanations, and because standards efforts often organize their meetings to be concurrent and co-located with other scientific meetings so that attendees can save time and travel expense.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><em>Face to face meetings</em>. The traditional type of meeting is physical, with attendees gathering together at a set time and location.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Symposium</em>: A symposium is a meeting to discuss a particular subject. Symposia usually place an emphasis on presentations: researchers and developers present information (often simply called “talks”) to an audience, with presentations scheduled and organized in a structured format. The presentations usually feature visual material projected on a large physical screen in front of the audience. Typically, after each presentation, the audience is invited to ask questions of the speaker. Symposia can be organized as single-track (one session at a time) or multiple track (multiple sessions held concurrently in separate rooms). They may also include panel discussions on various topics. Symposia usually charge modest or no registration fees and have shorter durations than conferences.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Workshop</em>: This is a generic term for a type of event that is smaller and shorter than a conference. It can be either presentation-style (i.e., a symposium) or interaction-style. The term <em>workshop</em> is often chosen instead of <em>symposium</em> to indicate a greater emphasis on discussion and participatory group activities, signal a less formal atmosphere to the meeting, and a shorter duration.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Hackathon</em>: A hackathon is a specialized type of workshop in which the emphasis is on active work and development: people gather together physical so that they can communicate more directly with each other while they work on the topic of the hackathon. Software development hackathons are common, but hackathons can be held for any topic, not only for software. The word “hack” is meant in the sense of rapid exploratory development (and not in the sense of criminal activities). Alternative terms for hackathon include <em>hackfest</em>, <em>codefest</em> and <em>jamboree</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Conference</em> or <em>congress</em>: The term <em>conference</em> is often chosen instead of symposium when the meeting is larger than a few hundred people, longer than one or two days, often (but not always) if it is regularly scheduled (e.g., annually), and when it offers an opportunity for commercial vendors to have displays. Conferences often include invited speakers too. Conferences usually charge higher registration fees than symposia; among other things, this pays for a larger venue, the invited speakers, and the production of <em>proceedings</em> publication. The contents of the proceedings are chosen from among peer-reviewed papers submitted to the conference. The term <em>congress</em> is sometimes used as an alternative name for a large, recurring conference; it tends to be used when a meeting is held less frequently than once per year, covers more than one field grouped under a broad umbrella, and is attended by very large audiences.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>Virtual meetings</em>. Face-to-face meetings are often effective, but they have significant drawbacks. Chief among these is that getting an international audience to gather in one place for several consecutive days can be expensive, time-consuming, and disruptive to individuals’ schedules. An additional, rarely considered factor is that people traveling to different time zones are often not at their cognitive best because of travel fatigue and jet lag; this reduces the effectiveness of the meeting overall and can lead to grumpy people behaving badly. Virtual meetings (or <em>teleconferences</em>) can be, and often are, a wortwhile alternative to physical meetings. Today’s technologies make virtual meetings more practical than ever before, and offer different options:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Text chat</em>: Many systems for real-time, text-based group chat exist today, such as the venerable IRC (Internet Relay Chat). Chat systems have very low bandwidth and technology requirements, and can be run from within web browsers; they are also usually cost-free to participants. Participants can share documents and other materials over the Internet at the same time. The use of text chat offers some additional, little-appreciated benefits: (1) it automatically provides a written record of the discussions; (2) it allows participants more time to think and formulate responses than when using voice or video, because the latter two often induce a feeling of “I better say <em>something</em>” in people even when they have not had time to think about their reply; (3) it can make it easier for participants with reduced English-speaking experience to participate; and (4) it can remove the potential impact of some interpersonal factors, such as tone of voice, that might otherwise influence the course of a conversation. On the other hand, chatting via text is slower because of the typing involved, and requires reasonable English reading and writing skills on the part of all the participants.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Conference call</em>: This type of virtual meeting involves no video, only audio/voice, often using either telephones or voice-over-IP services such as Skype. As with text chat, participants can usually share documents and other materials over the Internet at the same time. Due to the lower bandwidth and simpler technology requirements, conference calls are often chosen over videoconferences (especially by groups of people who already know each other), even though cameras are commonly built into computers and other devices today. For the same bandwidth reason, voice-only meetings also often can involve more people simultaneously than when videoconferencing is used.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Videoconference</em>, <em>web-based conference</em> or <em>online conference</em>: As the name implies, these virtual meetings involve video as well as voice. Traditionally, videoconferencing was performed using dedicated equipment (specialized cameras, televisions, etc.), but today they increasingly performed on regular computers using webcams and software such as Google Hangouts, Skype, WebEx, Adobe Connect, Fuze, and similar systems. Advanced systems allow users to share their computer screens as well as offer virtual whiteboards and other communication aids, making them useful when participants need to display visual information in real time. Typically, a <em>webinar</em> is more of a single-topic discussion</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>A general drawback of virtual meetings is that it is difficult to hold two-way virtual events with more than a small number of participants without specialized equipment. This is especially true of two-way videoconferences; the cost-free systems today such as Google Hangouts are limited to less than a dozen participants, and the quality is highly subject to the quality of the individual participants’ network connections. (Slow or unreliable connections lead to annoyance for everyone involved, not just the individual.) Thus, interactive virtual meetings are often limited to small group events, while larger virtual meetings are often broadcast-only (or with limited audience participation).</p>
<p>In standardization efforts, the most common types of meetings today are workshops, hackathons, text chats, conference calls and video conferences. The rest of this section focuses on workshops and hackathons, which require considerably more organization and planning than the other types of meetings.</p>
<h2 id="the-initial-organization-of-a-meeting"><span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> The initial organization of a meeting</h2>
<p>Whereas symposia and conferences tend to be created by a relatively set group of organizers, and presented to the world with a more-or-less fixed schedule, workshops and hackathons are often flexibly organized with the help of input from the potential audience. This poses a challenge for organization. The organization of a meeting should start as early as possible, both because potential participants need to have an idea of the program in order to decide whether to make arrangements to attend and because the organizers need to know how many people to expect. However, producing a detailed program <em>too</em> early can actually be counterproductive because (1) the program will almost certainly evolve as more people register and start to self-organize, yet (2) some people may not see their topic of interest right from the beginning and may decide not to attend.</p>
<p>When an international audience is expected, some travelers need many months of advance warning in order to start the process of securing visas to enter the country where the event will take place. This is particularly true of events in the USA, for which obtaining entry visas can take especially long for members of some countries – China and Russia are particularly notable in this regard. In addition, to obtain visas, a traveler often needs to show their home country a letter from the meeting organizers that indicates they (the traveler) are welcome to attend the meeting. Organizers must be prepared to field such requests. The process can require discussion with the traveler and writing letters tailored to each traveler’s particular case. (At the same time, organizers also need to be alert to potential visa scams involving requests for letters of invitation. For small events such as workshops and hackathons, it is rare, but not unheard of.)</p>
<p>Take together, these factors argue for roughly the following sequence of events:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>One year or more before the event, organizers should advertise the dates, location, overall theme(s), and general sessions of the planned event. This will allow people to decide if they are likely to go, and block out the dates in their calendar; travelers can also begin making plans for travel visas if they need them. At this point, a low-resolution agenda is sufficient.</p></li>
<li><p>Three quarters of a year before the event, the organizers should generate a coarse program with thematic blocks for all days. For COMBINE meetings and HARMONY hackathons, examples of such blocks may be “model description (SBML, CellML and related standards)”, “cross-COMBINE standards”, etc. At this stage, an initial allocation of rooms to sessions should also be made.</p></li>
<li><p>A minimum of six months in advance (sooner if possible), registration should be open for the event. For workshops with presentations, the registration process should include the possibility for participants to submit abstracts for talks; for both workshops and hackathons, registration should allow participant to submit poster abstracts.</p></li>
<li><p>As registrations accumulate, the editors of the different standards and/or the leaders of different working groups should be brought into the discussion to help define “their” session blocks in more detail. For workshops with presentations, chairs should also be nominated for each session at this point; for hackathons, chairs are not typically needed. The sessions should be adapted based on the registration trends: if very many people involved in a given standard have registered, then this standard will need to be allocated a large enough room for its sessions and (probably) more time in the overall schedule. If some topics are not receiving many registrants, the organizers may need to initiate additional outreach efforts to attract more people interested in that topic.</p></li>
<li><p>For workshops with presentations and/or tutorials, not less than two months before the event the session chairs (and the organizers and, if appropriate, the editorial boards of the different standardization efforts) should select speakers and their order.</p></li>
<li><p>Two weeks before the event begins, registration should be closed. Late registrations can always be accommodated on a case-per-case basis, but should remain rare.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, workshops and hackathons should be expected to be dynamic, living events, with the ability to change agendas as new topics emerge during the course of the meeting. Organizers should expect that they will need to accommodate these changes by adjusting the program during the meeting.</p>
<h3 id="tutorial-sesssions"><span class="header-section-number">5.2.1</span> Tutorial sesssions</h3>
<p><em>To be written…</em></p>
<h3 id="poster-sessions"><span class="header-section-number">5.2.2</span> Poster sessions</h3>
<p>Poster sessions need to have some dedicated time to them, perhaps combined with extended breaks in the afternoon. Without dedicated time in the schedule, many people simply never go to look at the posters because they are busy. In the past, people did not like combining the poster session with lunch, especially if lunch required going off-site. The location of the posters also makes a difference to the success of the poster session. If they are segregated in a separate room not visible to the main meeting room, fewer people visit. The ideal situation is if the posters are right outside of the main meeting room, or even inside (if the room is big enough).</p>
<h3 id="holidays-and-other-scheduling-conflicts"><span class="header-section-number">5.2.3</span> Holidays and other scheduling conflicts</h3>
<p>Attempting to avoid scheduling conflicts with religious holidays is essentially impossible. The problem is compounded for academics, because they often can only travel to meetings when they are not lecturing or teaching, which happen to be the same times when schoolchildren have <em>their</em> breaks from school … which are around the times of major religious holidays. The times when conflicts are least likely are in the summer, but then, a great many other workshops and conferences (and vacations) are scheduled in the summer months, which leads to other scheduling conflicts.</p>
<h2 id="practical-considerations-about-venues-for-workshops-and-hackathons"><span class="header-section-number">5.3</span> Practical considerations about venues for workshops and hackathons</h2>
<p>Potential hosts need to consider carefully whether they really have an appropriate venue and facilities to offer to host a workshop or hackathon. (It continues to astound us, as regular organizers, how many academics seem to give no thought to the implications of having, say, 80 people, <em>all with laptops</em> show up for a three day technical event expecting to use their laptops and internet connectivity <em>all the time, during every session of the meeting</em>.) In this section, we summarize lessons and conclusions about practical requirements for organizing technical workshops and hackathons.</p>
<h3 id="room-structure-and-seating"><span class="header-section-number">5.3.1</span> Room structure and seating</h3>
<p>In all cases, one main room is required for plenary presentations and main discussions. For a workshop that features presentations, the main room must have a computer projection system and projection screen; in addition, it should also have audio/microphone equipment so that people in the back can hear the speakers. The room should also provide ample electrical outlets and sufficient networking capacity – see the separate sections below.</p>
<p>Additional “breakout” rooms must be made available in the same building, for ad hoc discussions and meetings. Surveys conducted after past meetings revealed that people have disliked having presentations in the same room as where people are attempting to hack and work. On some occasions, fewer than the majority were interested in the presentation of a given topic, so the result of putting presentations and hacking in one room was that a greater number of people were distracted and inconvenienced. The implication is that for hackathons, it must be possible to have presentations for (say) half the attendees in a separate room from the main working room.</p>
<p>There should to be an overhead projector and projection screen or surface in each room, including the breakout rooms. If possible, the breakout rooms also should have whiteboards or some sort of group writing surfaces. Paper pads and pens/pencils come handy too, although it is not necessary to place one per desk/person; the materials could be left at the front of the room for those people who desire them.</p>
<p>The venue should not have an early closing or clear-out time. People sometimes want to work or have discussions right up to dinner time, and if the facilities forces them out by a certain time such as 18:00 (6 PM), it is inconvenient and disruptive. This is particularly important for workshops. If a cut-off time is unavoidable, then it must be reasonable – for example, a 5 PM cut-off time is simply too early and must be avoided.</p>
<h3 id="electricity"><span class="header-section-number">5.3.2</span> Electricity</h3>
<p>The lack of sufficient electrical outlets is one of the two most frequent and frustrating problems encountered by meeting attendees (the other being inadequate computer networking facilities). Hosts should remember that virtually all attendees of technical meetings today bring laptops, tablets, smartphones and other devices – and <em>they need to run them during the meetings</em>, even while attending other people’s presentations. During hackathons, the situation is even worse: 100% of the people need to run their computers 100% of the time. Consequently, it is essential to have power outlets for everyone in the room, distributed rationally throughout the room. It is simply not viable to have a few power outlets distributed around the periphery of the room – which is, sadly, all too common for most lecture rooms at academic institutions.</p>
<p>It is worth remembering that most attendees will not bring extension cords, so it is really not workable to have a room where power is only distributed only a few locations in the room. If a room does not have outlets in the desks or in the floor, the local organizers should make sure to bring a large number of power strips and power extension cords to the event. A nice bonus for international travelers is when the local organizers also bring some power plug adapters, for those people who forgot to bring their own.</p>
<h3 id="computer-networking"><span class="header-section-number">5.3.3</span> Computer networking</h3>
<p>It is critical to have a fast and reliable network that can handle a large number of people using it at the same time. As a rule of thumb, <em>everyone</em> at a hackathon will need to use the network, while in workshops, a good 75% or more of the people will. The capacity issue is serious. Many facilities claim to be able to support this capacity, but when tested, turn out to be unable to handle that many simultaneous users either in terms of bandwidth or in terms of the maximum number of DHCP addresses that can be allocated. What then happens during meetings is that the network saturates and frustrates everyone. (This has happened to us repeatedly, so we cannot overstate the importance of verifying that the network truly can handle the load.) <em>Do not simply trust what your networking/facilities/IT people or vendors claim.</em> They are very likely to tell you “it will be fine”, and they will be wrong. You need to <em>verify</em> the capacity or have direct experience from past meetings in the same room. Keep in mind that attendees will show up not only with laptops, but with WiFi-capable smartphones as well.</p>
<p>Wireless networking is preferrable. If only wired connections are available, the organizers should set up wireless base stations for people who don’t have wired networking available on their laptops and network devices. Also, provide enough access points and plenty of ethernet cables. Despite the predominance of wireless networking, having one or a few fast wired connections is still highly desirable, for example to be able to stream video of the sessions and in case the WiFi network collapses.</p>
<p>For hackathons, network access must be free to the attendees. For workshops, it is highly preferrable that access be free too, although a pay-for-access scheme also works. Complex security precautions are a strong negative. Particularly annoying are systems that require you to log in via a web page every time you reconnect to the network, or time out after (say) one hour of use.</p>
<p>Networking should be configured so that people can log to remote systems, download/upload files, etc. This means, for instance, that the ports used for common networking protocols should not be blocked by the network firewalls. At minimum, you should verify that the following are open and can be used without the need of proxy servers, and preferably without perimeter-level malware checks: SSH (port 22), DNS (ports 53, both TCP &amp; UDP), VPN (ports 47, 500, 1701, 1723, 5500), HTTP (ports 80 and preferrably 8080), and HTTPS (port 443). Other important protocols include the following: Submissions (587), IMAPS (993), MSN Messenger (1863), MQTT (1883), CVS (2401), Subversion (3690), XMPP/Jabber (5222), IRC (6665-9), and Git (9418).</p>
<p>At some venues, a technician has to be present during meetings; the costs for this have to be taken into consideration in the meeting budget.</p>
<p>Finally, organisers should make it clear to all attendees that the organizers and host institutions are not responsible or liabile for any intrusion or damage caused over the network. Attendees will often want to share network resources with other attendees, but it should be up to them to manage the security of their computers over the network.</p>
<h3 id="flexible-tablechair-arrangements"><span class="header-section-number">5.3.4</span> Flexible table/chair arrangements</h3>
<p>Hackathons require desks, preferably movable desks, and chairs. Workshops are also best served with movable desks and chairs, but lecture halls have also worked in the past. (However, if it is a lecture hall arrangement, then there must be power outlets near every seat so that people can still set up their laptops.)</p>
<h3 id="access-and-security-for-buildings-and-rooms"><span class="header-section-number">5.3.5</span> Access and security for buildings and rooms</h3>
<p>When planning and scheduling events, another issue to consider is whether people can get into the buildings and rooms without the help of someone who is a member of the institution or organization putting on the event. If there is a security system or check-in desk, make sure that somehow the building and rooms are consistently made accessible <em>before</em> the event starts every day. (More than once, we have found ourselves waiting outside of a locked building. It is very frustrating when it takes half an hour to set up video streaming equipment for an event that is scheduled to start at a certain time in the morning, waiting outside of a building that does not even open until the same time as the meeting is scheduled to start!)</p>
<h3 id="access-for-disabled-participants"><span class="header-section-number">5.3.6</span> Access for disabled participants</h3>
<p>Some participants need to travel by wheelchair or motorized mobility scooter. This means that the buildings in which meetings are held must have ramps and elevators so that attendees can get inside, and the rooms within the buildings also need to be accessible via wheelchair or mobility scooters. These considerations may affect the choice of rooms on the part of the local organizers.</p>
<h3 id="insurance"><span class="header-section-number">5.3.7</span> Insurance</h3>
<p>Something often forgotten is the dangers of personal accidents, theft, fire, natural disasters, or other contingencies. Organizers should determine whether the venue and attendees are insured in some way, perhaps thanks to the policies put in place by their institutions. If not, organizers should make attendees aware that they are on their own as far as risks are concerned.</p>
<h3 id="what-what-to-avoid"><span class="header-section-number">5.3.8</span> What what to avoid</h3>
<p>Avoid lecture-hall style seating arrangements with very tight spacing. If one can only get in and out of the rows from the sides, then people cannot get in or out of the middle seats without requiring all people in the intervening seats to get up and let them through. This is impossible for hackathons, and suboptimal even for talks during workshops.</p>
<p>Also avoid rooms where desktops are physically attached to the rows in front of each seat, with a fold-away arrangement, particularly those with a gap that can cause contents such as laptops to be easily spilled on the floor. (This has happened to people.)</p>
<h2 id="practical-considerations-about-lodging-and-transportation"><span class="header-section-number">5.4</span> Practical considerations about lodging and transportation</h2>
<p>Having a place to meet is important, but equally important is for participants to have reasonable places to stay and ways of getting to and from the city, lodgings, and meeting rooms.</p>
<h3 id="lodging"><span class="header-section-number">5.4.1</span> Lodging</h3>
<p>Sometimes hotels agree on special rates for events, which can be helpful to reduce the costs for participants. A list of appropriate hotels should be put on the web by the local organizers.</p>
<p>A range of hotels should ideally be within walking distance of the venue. Note that because of physical disabilities, some people will require taxis or other mode of transportation for anything over 1 city block, even if the hotels are in walking distance for most other people. For this reason, the option of taxi transportation must also exist. (In other words, it is a deal-breaker to be in a location where venue and hotels are separate and the only available mode of travel between the two is walking. It is impossible for some attendees to do this.)</p>
<p>Chartered bus transportation should be avoided if possible. In general, any mode of transportation that requires people to come and go at only a couple of specific times during the day is suboptimal. Public transportation is acceptable but people want to be able to come and go on their schedule, not someone else’s. So, walking, subways, regular trains, regular buses (as in a city), etc., are all good from that respect.</p>
<p>Just like at the meeting venue, it is critical that the hotel(s) haves fast and reliable networking. People work in their rooms before and after the meetings!</p>
<p>Athletic facilities available is a plus, either at the hotels or nearby. For a one-week stay, it becomes a consideration for people. This is more than simply the option of running outside. Some people may not be able to run due to physical reasons, but can use cardio equipment in a gym; moreover, weight training equipment is important to some people.</p>
<h3 id="transportation"><span class="header-section-number">5.4.2</span> Transportation</h3>
<p>It is vastly preferable if people can arrange their own reasonably-priced transportation from the airport to the hotels. The alternative of having to arrange transportation (either individual cars or vans) not only tends to be expensive for the organizers or hosts, but also is incredibly complicated to arrange. (It requires knowing everyone’s flight schedules, <em>and</em> it requires the organizers to be responsible for dealing with the situation where someone’s flight is delayed or cancelled, to avoid stranding that person at the airport. Generally speaking, this is a nightmare for whoever is responsible.)</p>

<h2 id="practical-considerations-about-miscellaneous-meeting-logistics"><span class="header-section-number">5.5</span> Practical considerations about miscellaneous meeting logistics</h2>
<p>You can get all of the details above right, and still end up with dissatisfied participants if they cannot easily find coffee and food throughout the meeting. This section discusses some minimal requirements in these regards for a successful meeting.</p>

<p><em>To be filled in …</em></p>
<h3 id="catering"><span class="header-section-number">5.5.2</span> Catering</h3>
<p>Coffee, tea, soft drinks and water needs to be available nearby. Note that coffee and tea by themselves are not enough: some people don’t drink either and really want soft drinks or water.</p>
<p>It is best to place the beverages outside the meeting room(s) and close to them. It is especially best to avoid having to go to another building altogether, for reasons of time, inconvenience, and possibly weather complications (e.g., rain or snow). It is also best not to have the beverages inside the same room where presentations are being held: people will be tempted to get up in the middle of presentations to get something, and this leads to clinking of dishes and utensils that will disrupt the ongoing presentations.</p>
<h3 id="food-and-beverages"><span class="header-section-number">5.5.3</span> Food and beverages</h3>
<p>If there are many restaurants and stores within walking distance of the hotels, not all meals have to be arranged by the organizers. Conversely, if the attendees are essentially trapped, then the organizers must arrange all meals. Note that the latter represents significantly more work and a higher cost to the organizers.</p>
<p>At least one group dinner should be arranged by the organizers or hosts. This will require having a restaurant or catering option that can handle large groups equal to approximately the number of people attending the workshop or hackathon.</p>
<p>Experience showed that fixed menus are preferable to prearranged dinners in which people have to choose from fixed menus earlier in the day, with the expectation that the restaurant will have the meals ready when they get there. People not only forget what they had ordered; they also tend to change their minds. If the aim is to feed a lot of people while giving people choices in what to eat, it is preferable to find a buffet.</p>
<h3 id="name-badges-and-handouts"><span class="header-section-number">5.5.4</span> Name badges and handouts</h3>
<p>Prepare name badges and relevant information (network access, local map, printed program) for participants. Give a welcome address and let participants know where they can find help (e.g., local oranizers).</p>
