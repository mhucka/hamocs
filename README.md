A Handbook for Academic Organizers of Community Standards
=========================================================

Many efforts to develop standards for computational systems biology have been created in the past, and more will undoubtedly be created in the future.  This handbook gathers experiences and recommendations from several successful efforts led by members of academic projects.  We hope that this handbook will help future standardization efforts avoid some of our mistakes and be more successful, more quickly.

How can you contribute?
-----------------------

You merely need a GitHub account.  I will add your account as a collaborator to the project on GitHub, and thereafter, you will be able to edit files directly.

How can you edit content?
-------------------------

The easiest way is to use GitHub's online file editor.  After you are added as collaborator, you will be able to edit files directly online.  Alternatively, you can edit and format the handbook on your local computer, and commit changes when you are ready.

(Please limit modifications to page editing for the time being.  If you want to try more extensive modifications, such as to change the document structure, then please clone the repository, make your changes privately, and then let's discuss the results before you do a pull request.  I request caution here because it would be easy to break the current HTML-generation system.)

### Editing online

### Editing a local copy

To use your own editor, you need to know a little bit about how to use git to create a clone on your computer's disk, how to commit changes to the repository, and how to push changes to GitHub.


How can you see the results of your edits?
-----------------------------------------

There is a system that watch the repository on GitHub.  When any change is committed to the repository, it automatically regenerates the HTML files and updates the HTML copy of the handbook at [http://mhucka.github.io/hamocs].  This process only takes a few seconds, so that normally within 10 seconds of your commit command, you can refresh the web page and see the results.
