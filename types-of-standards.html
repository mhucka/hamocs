<p>First, let’s be clear about what types of “technical standards” are the subject of this handbook. The focus is on technical standards in <em>information technology</em>: that is, data formats, procedural norms, technical processes and practices related to the use of computers, electronic communication and activities associated with them. The purpose of this chapter is to discuss different types of standards, different degrees of standardization, and different approaches to reaching standards.</p>

<p>Standards can be informal, as when an informal convention or product becomes generally used by a group of people even though nothing has ever been done to formalize its “standardness”, or they can be formal, the outcome of a concerted effort to reach consensus and somehow obtain some type of official recognition.</p>
<p>types of standards (see wikipedia): standard specification, standard test method, standard practice, etc.</p>

<p>Even within this narrow realm, the word <em>standard</em> tends to be used rather freely by many people.</p>

<p>“A technical standard may be developed privately or unilaterally, for example by a corporation, regulatory body, military, etc. Standards can also be developed by groups such as trade unions, and trade associations. Standards organizations often have more diverse input and usually develop voluntary standards: these might become mandatory if adopted by a government, business contract, etc.”</p>
<p>“The standardization process may be by edict or may involve the formal consensus[1] of technical experts.”</p>
