Many efforts to develop standards for computational systems biology have been created in the past, and more will undoubtedly be created in the future.  This handbook gathers experiences and recommendations from several successful efforts led by members of academic projects.  We hope that this handbook will help future standardization efforts avoid some of our mistakes and be more successful, more quickly.
